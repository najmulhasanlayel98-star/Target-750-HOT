Multiple social media posts promoting a "$750 Target gift card" are
scams designed to steal your personal information. Target's official security and fraud information explicitly warns customers about these types of "secret shopper" and "survey" scams. 
Warning signs of the scam

    Fake claim websites: Scam posts on Facebook and TikTok will often link to fake "reward" or "survey" websites not affiliated with Target.
    Requests for personal data: These sites may ask for your internet activity, browsing history, and other private data, which you implicitly "consent" to provide by using the website.
    Unrealistic rewards: Legitimate bonus and reward programs from Target offer less extravagant rewards than a free $750 gift card.
    Gift cards used for scams: Target clearly states that gift cards cannot be used to pay for a debt, fine, or taxes and warns against unsolicited contact asking you to purchase gift cards. 
    How to protect yourself

    Avoid clicking suspicious links: Do not click on links in unsolicited emails or social media posts promising large rewards or gift cards.
    Go directly to the official website: Check any reward offers on Target's official website or by logging into your Target Circle account.
    Use official Target programs: Target offers legitimate ways to earn rewards, like the Target Circle loyalty program, where members can earn 1% back on purchases. They also have an official "Hey, Bullseye" reviewer program, which offers free products for review to invited members, but does not offer large cash or gift card payments.
    Report scams: Report any suspected scams to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at ftc.gov/complaint.
